## Abstract
Convolutional neural networks have recently achieved great success in image super-resolution (SR). However, we notice an interesting phenomenon that these SR models are getting bigger, deeper, and more complex. Extensive models promote the development of SR, but the effectiveness, reproducibility and practical application prospects of these new models need further verification. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and accurate SR framework, named Super-Resolution Recursive Fractal Network (SRRFN). SRRFN introduces a flexible and diverse fractal module, which enables it to construct infinitely possible topological substructure through a simple component. We also introduce the recursive learning mechanism to maximize the use of model parameters. Extensive experiments show that our SRRFN achieves favorable performance against state-ofthe- art methods with fewer parameters and less execution time.

Fractal Structure: (a). self-similarity (b). infinitely fine structure (c). can be defined by a simple method and generated by recursion and iteration.


## Architecture

</p>

The architecture of our proposed Super-Resolution Recursive Fractal Network (SRRFN). All FMs are weight sharing.

The FM has no fixed structure. It consists of a basic component and a parameter (fractal depth, D). Different network structures can be generated by changing the component and depth.

## An example of FM

<p align="center">

</p>

We set D = 3, K = 3, N1 = 1, N2 = 10, N3 = 5, and S = 4 in the final SRRFN. This case is like a lightweight recursive RCAN.

It is worth noting that the purpose of this paper is to propose the idea of fractal framework. The basic components of FM can be easily replaced by existing network modules (e.g., dense block, memory block, and res2net blok).

### Training Dataset
We used DIV2K (1-800) dataset as our training dataset. Please download it from <a href="https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/">here</a>  or  <a href="https://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/EDSR/DIV2K.tar">SNU_CVLab</a>.

Extract the download file and put it into the Train/dataset.


### Training

The code will be released soon


## Testing

The code will be released soon

We also introduce self-ensemble strategy to improve our SRRFN and denote the self-ensembled version as SRRFN+.

More running instructions can be found in demo.sh.


## Performance

Following previous works, our SRRFN is trained on RGB images, but the reported PSNR/SSIM results are evaluated on the Y channel of the transformed YCbCr space.
